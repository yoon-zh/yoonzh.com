## What is it?

A new project built from scratch to showcase my work and connect with people in a dynamic way.

## Development

Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages.

### 1. Get a domain

Choose a name for the website, and see if it is available. You can buy domain names [here](https://www.namecheap.com/).

### 2. 

## Local Setup
```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Personal notes

This website is still being set up. It's a very new project and a learning process for me since I did not know anything about website development a week ago (today is 2025/02/14). In fact I didn't even planned on doing it whatsoever but a special person motivated me to do it so here it is.

From getting the domain, linking the IP, setting up a basic HTML that gpt gave me, to installing ruby and setting up Jekyll, moving to markdown files and arranging the style and format of the page...

It has been very motivating to see how far we've come in such a short time. I feel I haven't really worked on building my portfolio during the previous years but arranging the website and organizing my stuff here is very empowering.

I will continue to develop the website and add more projects and interesting stuff, play around with it and make it a part of me. Of course I am still learning and there will be lots of debugging ahead.
