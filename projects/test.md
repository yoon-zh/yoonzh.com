## What is it?

A test project post to review the layout of this website.

```c
puts("This is a codeblock in C");
```

## Why do we care about it?

It shows *core functionalities* and `page styles` I have ***added*** throughout the making of the **website**.

> This website is built with Jekyll, where most of the content is written in `.md` and compiled into `HTML`.

- It took about 1 week to set up Jekyll
- It is my first time using Ruby or making a website at all

***

This project is ***open source*** -> check it [here](https://github.com/yoon-zh/yoonzh.com "My website in GitHub")
