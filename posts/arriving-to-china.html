  <h1 id="1-prepping-before-you-get-here">1. Prepping before you get here</h1>

<p>before taking off, make sure your paperwork is solid. passports, visas, admission letters, insurance, college stuff… everything should be in order, because china isn’t shy about checking these things.</p>

<p>you should also be mentally prepared for <em>a lot</em> of bureaucracy. expect some paperwork, like registering with the police on the first dates or getting a local bank account.</p>

<h2 id="vpn">VPN</h2>

<p>expect any non-chinese apps to be blocked. google, youtube, instagram, whatsapp, chatgpt, telegram… as a foreigner, having a vpn is a MUST. set it up before coming. <em>if you don’t know, China is known for banning online content, mostly from other countries. a VPN is basically a tool that lets you bypass the ban. most foreigners NEED a VPN for daily stuff such as talking with our families back at home, managing home bank accounts, and other stuff like youtube, discord, netflix…</em></p>

<p>unless you’re very tech savyy, i suggest <a href="https://bitbucket.org/letsgo666/letsgo_en_1/src/main/README.md">this one</a> - <a href="https://github.com/LetsgoNetwork/LetsGo_EN_1/blob/main/README.md">alternate link</a>. USD 40 for a year (shorter time available). very very stable, have been using it for more than 6 months. although it only allows 2 devices. use my ID: 476989977 when registering for 3 free days.</p>

<p>if you want more options, look at this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/187vfnl/working_vpns_for_china_read_me_first/?rdt=34861">reddit post</a>. just dont get nord or express, they wont work.</p>

<h2 id="other-apps-you-need">other apps you NEED</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.wechat.com/">WeChat 微信</a>: used for EVERYTHING. messaging, payments, social media, even booking taxis. get it and set it up before you land.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mobile.alipay.com">Alipay 支付宝</a>: wechat 2.0 but mostly for paying bills, ordering food, booking hotels, and pretty much anything that involves money. bind your foreign bank card before flying, saves lots of headache.</li>
  <li><a href="https://mobile.amap.com/">amap 高德地图</a>: chinese map. everything google is blocked here, so you need a chinese map. i suggest this one. or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/百度地图-路线规划-出行必备/id452186370">baidu maps</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baidu.BaiduMap&amp;hl=zh">(android)</a>. it’s not perfect, but you’ll get around. and no, unfortunately theres no map in english… dont try to use others, they’re unreliable.</li>
  <li>translator app: i suggest <a href="https://www.deepl.com/app?utm_source=windows&amp;utm_campaign=share-with-friends&amp;utm_medium=app">deepL</a>. other translators should be fine too, as long as you have wifi or data. if youre studying chinese or staying for more than a few weeks, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pleco-chinese-dictionary/id341922306">pleco</a> dictionary is your best friend. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pleco.chinesesystem">(android version)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>keep in mind EVERYTHING here is done and paid in phone, expect no cash. so setting up 微信 or 支付宝 is crucial. yes, <strong>get both</strong>. if one gives trouble you have the other one.</p>

<p><em>bringing cash is not really necessary</em>. at most, maybe bring RMB 500 in cash for an emergency, like if your phone doesnt work.</p>

<h2 id="esim">ESIM</h2>

<p>if you can get an ESIM for your first 2 or 3 days it would greatly help you. ive never got one though, maybe read through this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/16nbsgu/best_esims_for_traveling_in_china/">reddit post</a>.</p>

<h1 id="2-expectations-when-you-land">2. expectations when you land</h1>

<p>china is an experience. be ready for some culture shock, because the pace and style of life here can be way different from what you’re used to. a few things to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>police registration</strong>: you have to go to your local police office and register within the first 2-3 days you land. take your passport, accommodation registration, and admission notice from university. <strong>you need a local phone number to register</strong>. if you dont have one, get one or write your university’s number.</li>
  <li><strong>language</strong>: you’re probably not fluent in chinese (or maybe you are, flex). but you’re gonna be in situations where even basic chinese will be super helpful. get familiar with some phrases. try hellochinese - <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hellochinese-learn-chinese/id1001507516">iOS</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hellochinese">android</a>. i dont like duolingo, i dont recommend it for chinese.</li>
  <li><strong>air pollution</strong>: depending on where you’re at, the air quality might be a little… questionable. masks are normal here, so bring some along or just buy them locally. check the air quality index of your destination.</li>
  <li><strong>public transportation</strong>: public transport is pretty great in most cities, and taxis are everywhere. that said, <em>don’t rely on google maps for anything</em>, it’s basically useless here. use <a href="https://mobile.amap.com/">amap</a>, take the metro, or call a cab - theyre <em>dirty cheap.</em></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="3-money-matters">3. money matters</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>currency</strong>: the currency is the yuan: ¥ - CNY - RMB - 元 - 人民币… prices are cheap unless youre in beijing or shanghai. i check currency rates <a href="https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>paying by phone</strong>: no cash, no physical cards, no apple pay - <strong>only wechat/alipay</strong>, make sure you have them downloaded and a card binded to feed the money.</li>
  <li><strong>withdrawing money</strong>: you <em>might</em> have some trouble with international cards. not all foreign cards work everywhere. <em>in my experience, ICBC and HSBC ATMs are reliable, others not so much</em>. if you’re staying for a couple months, get a local bank account as soon as possible. <em>i have ICBC, it works ok.</em></li>
  <li><strong>living costs</strong>: expect some variation. smaller cities are pretty cheap, but in places like beijing or shanghai, costs can skyrocket. on average, rent might run you anywhere from ¥2000 to ¥8000/month, depending on where you are and if your university provides housing. <em>i pay 1800 per month in suzhou, as of 2025</em>. food is cheap, especially street food, but western stuff can burn a hole in your wallet if youre not careful.</li>
  <li><strong>sim cards</strong>: get a local sim card for your phone as soon as possible. <strong>phone numbers are VERY important here.</strong> the major carriers (china mobile 中国移动, china unicom 中国联通) all offer student-friendly deals, and they’ll hook you up with a number and data plan. <strong>talk with your university about this</strong>. mine has some sort of local agreement and they give me a ¥60 plan with 100 GB of data per month. pretty good if you ask me.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="4-getting-around">4. getting around</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>public transport</strong>: metros and buses are everywhere, and they’re dirt cheap (¥2–¥5 per ride). you can get a physical transport card and reload it as needed, or you can set it up on alipay (press the transport button in main menu) and use a QR like a real chinese. if you don’t read chinese, alipay has your back (supports other languages, should load in your phone’s language)</li>
  <li><strong>didi 滴滴</strong>: china’s version of uber, but better and cheaper. you’ll need to link a payment method (like wechat or alipay) to your account, and you can get rides from basically anywhere. if you’re stuck late at night, having drinks or just feeling lazy, this is your go-to option. you can use it from one of wechat’s mini apps, or just download didi’s app <a href="https://www.didiglobal.com/download">here</a>. if you can read chinese, you can do fancier stuff like setting it up from amap高德地图 too.</li>
  <li><strong>driving</strong>: don’t expect to drive a car here. the chinese dont care about your country’s license, you’ll need a local drivers license (驾照) regardless of your nationality. <em>however,</em> you’ll notice the massive amount of bikes (and e-bikes) around the street. for the yellow ones, you can rent them with meituan美团. ask your university for more info on that if you’re into bikes.</li>
  <li><strong>e-bikes</strong>: some foreign students buy e-bikes like the chinese. you <em>can</em> buy one and use it, you dont need a license as of 2025 (ive heard it starts from ¥3000), but keep in mind <em>most are illegal</em> (their speed limit is 25 km/h, but the stores mod them to increase the cap). if you get into an accident while driving an illegal e-bike, <strong>your insurance may not cover you.</strong> i dont know the details, but make sure to know your stuff if you want to get one.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="5-food--dining">5. food &amp; dining</h1>

<p>china has some of the best food in the world, but it can also be a bit… different. don’t freak out though. here are some basics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>restaurants</strong>: don’t expect a menu in english, maybe not even a physical menu. look for the QR code that says “扫码点菜”, “扫码点单” or sth like that (sometimes they’re in the tables). get the translate feature in wechat/alipay for help with menus or just play laowai, point at stuff and hope for the best.</li>
  <li><strong>street food</strong>: this is where it’s at. dumplings 包子, skewers串, hotpot火锅. get your hands dirty and try it all. don’t worry <em>too much</em> about hygiene, the food’s mostly safe - especially after covid. you might get a <em>little</em> stomach upset at first, but you’ll get over it.</li>
  <li><strong>delivery</strong>: if you’re lazy (just like everyone else), <a href="http://www.meituan.com/mobile/">meituan美团</a> and <a href="https://www.ele.me/waimai">eleme饿了么</a> deliver to your door. just make sure to use wechat or alipay to pay. <em>i like meituan.</em></li>
  <li><strong>spicy food</strong>: in chinese, “辣” (là) means spicy. write this word down. if you’re not used to spicy food (like an italian or south american), beware - the “small spicy” options can be much stronger. <em>sichuan food 四川菜 is known for being spicy.</em> i wouldnt suggest it as your first dish unless you’re korean.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="6-cultural-quirks">6. cultural quirks</h1>

<ul>
  <li><strong>personal space</strong>: forget the concept of personal space. you’re going to be jostled on the metro, people will get uncomfortably close in line, and don’t even get me started on the elevator situation.</li>
  <li><strong>queueing</strong>: <em>in my experience, it’s not as respected as before covid.</em> some people in the metro will just stand in front of the door and dont give a fk.</li>
  <li><strong>loudness</strong>: chinese people aren’t shy about making noise. don’t be surprised if your neighbors are arguing in the hallway or if street vendors are blasting music. it’s just how it is.</li>
  <li><strong>scams</strong>: if some random chinese gets a bit too friendly and “invites you” to a tea or coffee at a <strong>non branded store</strong>, its 99% a scam. ive never experienced it, but ive heard stories of people paying ¥500 for a cup of tea. keep in mind, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/18tz19q/scammed_in_shanghai_need_help_recovering_money/">dating apps are full of scammers.</a> if you’re worried about scammers, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1ilyfrg/visiting_shanghai_read_this_before_you_get_scammed/">read this</a>, although dont worry too much about it. maybe keep some distance and you’ll be fine.</li>
  <li><strong>safety</strong>: despite the amount of people, china’s one of the safest countries out there. just dont do stupid stuff, avoid chinese politics, and you’ll be fine. <em>ive walked in many random places at 3 am, not a single concern.</em></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="7-whats-next">7. what’s next?</h1>

<p>once you’ve survived the first few weeks, you’ll start getting the hang of things. make local friends, improve your chinese (duh), and start enjoying the ride. make sure to keep an eye on the dates and your legal papers like visas and residence permits. china’s an experience - one that can be overwhelming at first, but you’ll learn to love it. or not. who knows.</p>

<p><em>if youre coming soon and freaking out a bit or have a specific question, you may drop a message on my <a href="https://t.me/yo_o_n">telegram</a>. note im not a legal advisor, just some foreigner living here who has dealt with chinese stuff for a good couple times.</em>
