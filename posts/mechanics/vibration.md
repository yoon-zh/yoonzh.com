## Springs

Simple hooke's law for linear springs:

$$F = k\delta$$

Where
- $$F$$ is force
- $$k$$ is stiffness of spring
- $$\delta$$ is deformation of spring

Springs in parallel:

$$k_{eq} = \sum k_i$$

Springs in series:

$$\frac{1}{k_{eq}} = \sum \frac{1}{k_i}$$

aka same as capacitors.

## Resonant frequency

$$\omega = \sqrt{\frac{K}{M}}$$

Where
- $$\omega$$ is natural resonance frequency
- $$K$$ is stiffness of object
- $$M$$ is mass of object
