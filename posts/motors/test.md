### Given Parameters

Dimensions: Length $$l$$, cross-sectional area $$A = \text{width} \times \text{depth}$$

Number of turns $$N$$

Magnetization curve: $$B\ \text{vs.}\ H$$ for the material.

### To Obtain

1. Total flux $$\Phi$$
2. Flux density $$B$$
3. Magnetizing intensity $$H$$
4. Current $$I$$
5. Reluctance $$\Re$$

### Corner cases:

- Possible air gap
- Fringing (assume increase in effective air-gap area)

## Solution

### 1. Magnetic Path Geometry

- Calculate the mean path length $$l$$ of the region
- Compute the cross-sectional area $$A$$:

$$
A = \text{width} \times \text{depth}
$$


### 2. Relate Flux Density $$B$$ and Flux $$\Phi$$


For the specific region, flux density is

$$
B = \frac{\Phi}{A}
$$

If $$\Phi$$ is unknown, proceed to Step 3 to find $$B$$ indirectly.

### 3. Magnetizing Intensity $$H$$

Use the magnetization curve $$B\ \text{ vs. }\ H$$ to determine $$H$$ for the calculated $$B$$.

For air gaps, use

$$
H = \frac{B}{\mu_0} \quad \text{where } \mu_0 = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{H/m}
$$

### 4. MMF Drop for the Region

The magnetomotive force (MMF) drop across the region is

$$
\mathcal{F} = H \times l
$$

### 5. Total MMF and Current $$I$$

For the entire circuit, total MMF is:

$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text{total}} = N \times I
$$

If the region is part of a series circuit, sum MMF drops across all regions:

$$
N \times I = \sum (H_k \times l_k)
$$

Solve for current:

$$
I = \frac{\sum (H_k \times l_k)}{N}
$$

### 6. Reluctance $$\Re$$

Reluctance of the region is

$$
\Re = \frac{\mathcal{F}}{\Phi} = \frac{H \times l}{\Phi}
$$

If the material is linear (constant permeability $$ \mu $$):

$$
\Re = \frac{l}{\mu \times A} \quad \text{where } \mu = \frac{B}{H}
$$

### 7. Nonlinear Materials

If the $$B\ \text{-}\ H$$ curve is nonlinear and $$\Phi$$ is unknown:

1. Assume a trial value for $$\Phi$$
2. Compute $$B = \Phi / A$$ for all regions
3. Use the $$B\ \text{-}\ H$$ curve to find $$H$$ for magnetic regions
4. Calculate total MMF $$\mathcal{F}_{\text{total}} = \sum (H_k \times l_k)$$
5. Compare with $$N \times I$$, adjust $$\Phi$$ and repeat until convergence

# Transformers

## Ideal Transformers

Turns ratio:

$$
a = \frac{N_p}{N_s} = \frac{v_p (t)}{v_s (t)}
$$

Where $$N_p,\ N_s$$ are the turns in the wires, and $$v_p (t),\ v_s (t)$$ the voltages.

For the current:

$$
N_p i_p (t) = N_s i_s (t)
$$

$$
\frac{i_p (t)}{i_s (t)} = \frac{1}{a}
$$

In phasor notation,

$$
\frac{V_P}{V_S} = \frac{1}{a}
$$

$$
\frac{I_P}{I_S} = \frac{1}{a}
$$

The input voltage and current has the same phase angle as the output.

> Real Power:

> $$P_{in} = V_P I_P cos {\theta}_P$$
>
> Where $${\theta}_P$$ is the angle between $$V_P$$ and $$I_P$$.
>
> Similarly for output power,
>
> $$P_{out} = V_S I_S cos {\theta}_S$$

> $$Q_{in} = V_P I_P sin \theta = V_S I_S sin \theta = Q_{out}$$
>
> $$S_{in} = V_P I_P = V_S I_S = S_{out}$$

A transformer's voltage and current can change the apparent impedance:

$$
Z_L = \frac{V_S}{I_S} 
$$

$$
Z'_L = \frac{V_P}{I_P} = a^2 Z_L = \left(\frac{N_P}{N_S}\right)^2 Z_L
$$

## Real Transformers

Excitation current: total no-load current in the core.

$$
i_{ex} = i_m + i_{h+e}
$$

Where

- $$i_M$$ is the magnetization current required to produce flux in the transformer core
- $$i_{h+e}$$ is the core-loss current lost to hysteresis and eddy current

$$i_{ex}$$ should be much smaller than full-load current in a good transformer.

$$
\mathcal{F}_{net} = N_P i_P - N_S i_S = \phi\ \Re
$$

For a real transformer to be modelled as an ideal, the core must have no hysteresis or eddy currents, as well as zero leakage flux and zero resistance in transformer windings.

Equivalent circuit considering:
- Copper losses $$I^2 R$$
- Eddy current losses
- Hysteresis losses
- Leakage flux $${\phi}_{LP},\ {\phi}_{LS}$$, producing leakage inductance

Leakage inductance:

$$
L_P = N^2_P \mathcal{P}
$$

$$
L_N = N^2_N \mathcal{P}
$$

Where $$\mathcal{P}$$ is the permeance of flux path (air).

## draft

## Excitation branch

In real transformers, the excitation branch accounts for core losses and magnetizing current. It consists of a core loss resistance $$R_C$$ (modeling hysteresis and eddy current losses) and a magnetizing reactance $$X_M$$ (modeling the magnetization current):

$$
I_P = I_C + I_M
$$

Where:
- $$I_C = \frac{V_P}{R_C}$$ (in-phase with voltage)
- $$I_M = \frac{V_P}{X_M}$$ (lags voltage by 90Â°)

## Resistances and leakage reactances

Practical transformers have:
- Winding resistances $$R_P,\ R_S$$ (copper losses)
- Leakage reactances $$X_P,\ X_S$$ (due to imperfect flux linkage)

These are modeled as series elements with the ideal transformer:

$$
Z_P = R_P + jX_P \quad \text{(Primary side)}
$$

$$
Z_S = R_S + jX_S \quad \text{(Secondary side)}
$$

## High-voltage side, low-voltage side

- High-voltage (HV) side: Has more turns ($$N_P > N_S$$), operates at higher voltage and lower current
- Low-voltage (LV) side: Has fewer turns ($$N_S < N_P$$), operates at lower voltage and higher current

The turns ratio determines voltage transformation:

$$
a = \frac{N_{HV}}{N_{LV}} = \frac{V_{HV}}{V_{LV}}
$$

## Terminal Voltage

The actual output voltage under load differs from the ideal voltage due to voltage drops:

$$
V_{terminal} = V_S - I_S(R_S + jX_S)
$$

## High-side current

The primary current has two components:
1. Load current reflected from secondary: $$I'_S = \frac{I_S}{a}$$
2. Excitation current: $$I_{EX} = I_C + I_M$$

$$
I_P = I'_S + I_{EX}
$$

## Low-side real power

Real power delivered to load:

$$
P_{out} = V_S I_S \cos \theta_S
$$

## Low-side reactive power

Reactive power delivered to load:

$$
Q_{out} = V_S I_S \sin \theta_S
$$

## Power factor lagging/leading

- Lagging PF: Inductive load (current lags voltage)
- Leading PF: Capacitive load (current leads voltage)

Power factor angle $$\theta$$ relates voltage and current:

$$
\theta = \angle V_S - \angle I_S
$$

## Equivalent T circuit

The complete transformer model combines series impedances and shunt excitation branch:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
 & R_P + jX_P & \\
V_P & \longrightarrow & \text{Ideal Transformer} (a:1) \\
 & \downarrow R_C \parallel jX_M & \\
\end{array}
$$

## Input voltage

The required primary voltage to maintain secondary terminal voltage:

$$
V_P = aV_S + I_P(R_P + jX_P)
$$

## Copper loss

Power loss in windings:

$$
P_{cu} = I_P^2 R_P + I_S^2 R_S = I_P^2 R_P + \left(\frac{I_P}{a}\right)^2 R_S
$$

## Core loss

Power loss in magnetic core:

$$
P_{core} = \frac{V_P^2}{R_C}
$$

## Efficiency

Ratio of output power to input power:

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}} \times 100\% = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{out} + P_{cu} + P_{core}} \times 100\%
$$

## Cantilever equivalent circuit

Approximate model with excitation branch moved to primary side:

$$
\begin{array}{ccc}
R_P + jX_P & \longrightarrow & \text{Ideal Transformer} (a:1) \\
 & \downarrow R_C \parallel jX_M & \\
\end{array}
$$

## Example: 30 kVA 60 Hz 2100 V:420 V Transformer

Given:
- 30 kVA, 60 Hz, 2100 V:420 V
- $$R_P = 1.5 \Omega$$, $$X_P = 2.0 \Omega$$ (HV side)
- $$R_S = 0.06 \Omega$$, $$X_S = 0.08 \Omega$$ (LV side)

Calculations:
1. Turns ratio:
$$
a = \frac{2100}{420} = 5
$$

2. Impedance referral:

- LV-side impedances referred to HV side:

$$
R'_S = a^2 R_S = 25 \times 0.06 = 1.5 \Omega
$$

$$
X'_S = a^2 X_S = 25 \times 0.08 = 2.0 \Omega
$$

Load Calculation:
For 420 V terminal voltage at 0.8 PF lagging:

1. Low-side current:

$$
I_S = \frac{30,000}{420} = 71.43 \text{A}
$$

2. High-side current:

$$
I_P = \frac{I_S}{a} = \frac{71.43}{5} = 14.29 \text{A}
$$

3. Low-side powers:

- Real power:

$$
P = 420 \times 71.43 \times 0.8 = 24,000 \text{W}
$$

- Reactive power:

$$
Q = 420 \times 71.43 \times \sqrt{1-0.8^2} = 18,000 \text{VAR}
$$
