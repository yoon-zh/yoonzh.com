## In a nutsell: Magnets

Magnets are the key behind a motor's operation. Everyone knows opposite poles attract, equal poles repulse... Some engineers found out a cable arranged as a spring (aka inductor) can create a magnetic field when current flows. And masterminds like Nikola Tesla exploited these physics to create motors.

Before we can choose a motor for our robots and cars, we need a grasp of how it works.

# Anatomy

Motors can be divided into 2 main components: **Stator** and **Rotor**.
