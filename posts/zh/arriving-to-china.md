# 1. Prepping before you get here

before taking off, make sure your paperwork is solid. passports, visas, admission letters, insurance, college/work stuff, certificates... everything should be in order, because china isn't shy about checking these things.

bring a printed copy of *everything* for immigration if they ask. be prepared for some bureaucracy.

unless you speak Chinese, keep a [translator](https://www.deepl.com/en/translator) handy!


## VPN - get one before coming

expect any non-chinese apps to be blocked. google, youtube, telegram, whatsapp, chatgpt, instagram... as a foreigner, having a vpn is a MUST. set it up in your devices before traveling.

*if you're not aware, China is known for banning online content, mostly from other countries. a VPN is basically a tool that lets you bypass the ban. most foreigners NEED a VPN for daily stuff such as talking with our families back at home, managing home bank accounts, and other stuff like youtube, discord, netflix...*

unless you wanna set up a server yourself, i suggest [letsvpn](https://d1gx3j8kwj94us.cloudfront.net/?lp_alattr=true&shortlink=a60e7e13&c=referral-homepage&pid=referral&source_caller=ui). USD 40 for a year (shorter time available). very very stable, have been using it for more than 6 months. although it only allows 2 devices. *use my ID: 476989977* when registering for 3 free days.

if you want more options, look at this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/187vfnl/working_vpns_for_china_read_me_first/?rdt=34861). just dont get nord or express, they wont work.


## Apps you NEED

- [WeChat 微信](https://www.wechat.com/): used for EVERYTHING. messaging, payments, social media, even booking taxis. get it and set it up before you land.
- [Alipay 支付宝](https://mobile.alipay.com): payment app, everything about money. paying bills, ordering food, bus/metro QRs, booking hotels, yada yada. bind your foreign bank card before flying, saves lots of headache.
- [Amap 高德地图](https://mobile.amap.com/): chinese map. *dont use google maps, it is not accurate here*. two popular map apps are  [amap](https://mobile.amap.com/) and baidu maps: [(iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/百度地图-路线规划-出行必备/id452186370) - [(android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.baidu.BaiduMap&hl=zh). *if you have apple, you can also use apple maps.*
- Translator app: i suggest [deepL](https://www.deepl.com/app?utm_source=windows&utm_campaign=share-with-friends&utm_medium=app). other translators should be fine too, as long as you have wifi or data. if you're studying chinese or staying for more than a few weeks, pleco (dictionary) is your best friend. [(iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pleco-chinese-dictionary/id341922306) - [(android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pleco.chinesesystem)

> everything here is done and paid in phone, expect no cash. so setting up wechat微信 and alipay支付宝 is crucial. get both.

*bringing cash is not that necessary*. maybe bring RMB 500 for an emergency, like if your phone doesnt work and you're stuck at the airport.

## E-SIM

if you can get an ESIM before coming, go for it. ive never got one though, maybe read through this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/16nbsgu/best_esims_for_traveling_in_china/). i think you can also buy one in Alipay 支付宝.

# 2. expectations when you land

china is an experience. be ready for some culture shock, because the pace and style of life here can be way different from what you're used to. a few things to keep in mind:

### Police registration

unless staying at a hotel, you have to go to your local police office and register within the first 2-3 days you land. 

> take your passport, accommodation registration, and admission notice from university (or work papers).
>
> you need a local phone number to register. if you dont have one, write down your university's or office number (or a chinese friend if you have).
>
> do NOT go to a random police station, there is one specific to the address you're staying in (ask the landlord).
>
> you *can* do this online, but i *strongly* recommend going physically to avoid surprises.

### public transportation

public transport is great in most cities, and taxis are everywhere. if you need a taxi from the airport, get [Didi滴滴出行](https://www.didiglobal.com/download). *uber does not exist here.* 

however, expect your taxi to smell like cigarrette...

### do NOT expect public wifi

the only places that *might* have wifi consistently are starbucks星巴克, mcdonalds麦当劳, airports (sometimes), and your university campus. getting a phone number with a decent amount of data is key. *i use over 100 GB monthly, at roughly 9 USD.*

### Medical check-up

if you're an X1 student (studying for more than 6 months), you have to take a medical check-up locally. this is usually arranged by your university on the first week. make sure to write down the details, take your passport with you, and expect fasting.

### language

you’re probably not fluent in chinese (or maybe you are, flex). but you're gonna be in situations where even basic chinese will be super helpful. dont expect people to know english. get familiar with some phrases. try [HelloChinese](https://www.hellochinese.cc/). *i dont like duolingo for chinese.*

if you're into learning chinese, pleco (dictionary) is your best friend. [(iOS)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pleco-chinese-dictionary/id341922306) - [(android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pleco.chinesesystem)

### "this app is not available in your region"

if using iphone, create a new apple id and set its country to china. *i suggest making a new, separate account from your main one.* 

if using android or other, check this [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/chinalife/comments/18evxyh/what_android_app_store_do_you_use_for_chinese_apps/) (google is banned, so not many chinese apps on google store). i'd suggest asking a local if this is your case.

# 3. money matters

### currency

the currency is the yuan: ¥ - CNY - RMB - 元 - 人民币... prices are cheap unless youre in beijing or shanghai. i check currency rates [here](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/). 

### paying by phone

no cash, no physical cards, no apple pay: **only wechat/alipay**, make sure you have them downloaded and a card binded.

### withdrawing money

you *might* have some trouble with international cards. not all foreign cards work everywhere. *in my experience, ICBC and HSBC ATMs are reliable*.

if you're staying for a couple months, get a local bank account after getting a phone number. *i have ICBC, it works ok.*

### living costs

expect some variation. smaller cities are pretty cheap, but in places like beijing or shanghai, costs can skyrocket. on average, rent might run you anywhere from ¥2000 to ¥8000/month, depending on where you are and if your university provides housing. *i pay ¥1800 per month in suzhou苏州, as of 2025*.

food is cheap, especially street food, but western stuff can burn a hole in your wallet if youre not careful.
- average chinese meal: ¥20 - 40
- nice meal in a shopping mall: ¥60 - 80
- western style: ¥80+

of course, it depends on how picky you are about food. meals with friends are usually cheaper. *i get away with about ¥4500 a month, including rent, food and transportation.*


### sim cards

> get a local sim card for your phone as soon as you arrive. phone numbers are VERY important here.

the major carriers (china mobile 中国移动, china unicom 中国联通) all offer student-friendly deals, and they’ll hook you up with a number and data plan. **talk with your university about this**. mine has some sort of local agreement and they give me a ¥60 plan with 100 GB of data per month. pretty good if you ask me.

### taobao 淘宝

you may have heard that packages and deliveries here are super cheap. yes, it's true. get [taobao淘宝](https://login.taobao.com/member/login.jhtml).

if you live in dorms, your packages may arrive to a [cainiao station菜鸟驿站](https://www.cainiao.com/technology-cainiao-app.html) instead of your door, so ask your reception and download the app if so.


# 4. getting around

expect metro in all major cities. expect bullet trains to *everywhere* in the country. expect cheap taxis and buses. china's public transportation is S tier.

### from the airport to your place

if new to china, set up [didi](https://www.didiglobal.com/download) and get a taxi. or you can also go to the designated taxi area and pick one (more expensive than didi).

if coming for studies or work, talk with your university/office, they usually help booking a pickup, sometimes they pick you up themselves.

if you speak chinese, you could take the city metro 地铁, or train 高铁 if going between cities (ex, arriving to beijing北京 but going to tianjin天津).

### public transport: metro & bus

metros and buses are everywhere, and they’re dirt cheap: ¥2–¥5 per ride (less than a dollar). you can set it up on [Alipay 支付宝](https://mobile.alipay.com): in main menu, press the "transport" button, open the card, and use a QR code. or, you can get a physical transport card and reload it as needed. 

### didi 滴滴

china’s version of uber, but better and cheaper. download it [here](https://www.didiglobal.com/download). you’ll need to link a payment method (like wechat or alipay) to your account, and you can get rides from basically anywhere. if you’re stuck late at night, having drinks, or just feeling lazy, this is your go-to option. the driver does not take cash, make sure you pay through the app.

if you can read chinese, you can do fancier stuff like setting up taxis from [Amap 高德地图](https://mobile.amap.com/) too.

### bullet trains 高铁 and flights

the official platform for trains is [12306](https://www.12306.cn) (english available). you can also use [trip](https://www.trip.com/pages/appdownload/?locale=en-XX&curr=USD) (foreign version) or [ctrip携程旅行](https://app.ctrip.com/app/) (local version).

> you NEED your passport when taking trains, just like flights.

for nearby cities, a one-way bullet train ticket goes for ¥50-100. make sure to use them when visiting nearby cities (say, shanghai上海 > suzhou苏州 > hangzhou杭州). for longer distances, you may wanna compare with flights.

i buy national flights in [ctrip携程旅行](https://app.ctrip.com/app/). if you need english, you may use [trip](https://www.trip.com/pages/appdownload/?locale=en-XX&curr=USD).

### driving

don't expect to drive a car here, you'll need a local license驾照 regardless of your nationality. converting an overseas license into a local one is usually not straightforward, read more [here](https://english.shanghai.gov.cn/en-Transportation/20240102/07a427babba44f72aed9de96cf5f434a.html).

*however,* you'll notice the massive amount of bikes (and e-bikes) around the street. for the yellow ones, you can rent them with [meituan美团](http://www.meituan.com/mobile/). the blue ones are from [Alipay 支付宝](https://mobile.alipay.com). ask your university/office for more info.

### e-bikes

some foreign students buy e-bikes like the chinese. you *can buy one and use it* (ive heard it starts from ¥3000), you dont need a license as of 2025. but keep in mind *most are illegal* (their legal speed limit is 25 km/h, but stores mod them to increase the cap and show 25).

> if you get into an accident while driving an illegal e-bike, your insurance may not cover you. make sure to know your stuff if you're buying an e-bike.

a safer choice is renting, just like the normal bikes. so there are both standard bikes and e-bikes you can rent via [meituan美团](http://www.meituan.com/mobile/) and [Alipay 支付宝](https://mobile.alipay.com).

# 5. food & dining

china has some of the best food in the world, but it can also be a bit… different. don’t freak out though. here are some basics:

### Restaurants

don’t expect a menu in english, or a physical menu at all. look for the QR codes that say "扫码点菜", "扫码点单" or sth like that (sometimes they're in the tables). get the translate feature in wechat/alipay for help with menus. or just play laowai, point at stuff and hope for the best. if you can read some chinese and wanna search for restaurants, use [大众点评](https://h5.dianping.com/app/app-m-user-growth/index.html).

> if you have allergies or diet requierements (vegan), write them down in chinese and carry them with you.

### Street food

this is where it’s at. dumplings (baozi包子、jiaozi饺子、xiaolongbao小笼包), skewers (chuan串), hotpot (huoguo火锅). if you're adventurous, get your hands dirty and try it all. don’t worry too much about hygiene, the food’s mostly safe, especially after covid. you might get a little stomach upset at first, but you’ll get over it.

*golden rule: if crowded, the food's good. if not, better look somewhere else.*


### Delivery

[meituan美团](http://www.meituan.com/mobile/) and [eleme饿了么](https://www.ele.me/waimai) deliver to your door. depending where you order, they may deliver to some lockers (外卖柜), so keep an eye on where they are. *i like meituan.*

when ordering, you may notice they call you when they arrive. if you dont speak chinese, you may just ignore it. if they call twice, the driver might have gotten lost. look for a chinese person to help you answer if so.

### Spicy food

in chinese, "辣" (là) means spicy. write this word down. chinese food can vary a lot, but spicy food is relatively common. 

if you're not used to spicy food (for example, you're italian), beware - the "small spicy 微辣" options can be much stronger than expected. *sichuan food 川菜 is known for being spicy.* i wouldnt suggest it as your first dish.

### Coffee, Tea, Drinks

China's a golden mine for coffee and tea lovers. expect ¥15 (2 USD) in average per cup, both for coffee and tea. alcohol in bars may start around ¥30, although i dont drink so im not sure.

for coffee, look for Luckin瑞幸咖啡, Manner, Algebraist... china's full of caffeine addicts, so choices are plenty. *starbucks still charges ¥40 a cup (same US prices), so id avoid it.*

for tea, look for HeyTea喜茶, ChaPanda茶百道, A Little Tea一点点... but honestly just try it all. china's full of tea, so look for one that you like.

note: in china, red beans are mainly used in sweet food. you may stumble upon them in a drink or ice cream. i personally dont like it, so be aware if your tea or ice cream says 红豆.

# 6. cultural quirks

### Personal space

when commuting, personal space wont exist. you’re going to be jostled on the metro, people will get uncomfortably close in line, and don't even get me started on the elevator situation.

### Queueing

*in my experience, it was better before covid.* some people in the metro will cut queues stand in front of the door and dont give a fk.

### Loudness

chinese ppl aren’t shy about making noise. don't be surprised if your neighbors are arguing in the hallway or if someones blasting douyin抖音 in the bus. it's just how it is.

### Scams

if some random chinese gets a bit too friendly and "invites you" to a tea or coffee at a **non branded store**, its 100% a scam. ive never experienced it, but ive heard stories of people paying ¥500 for a cup of tea. keep in mind, [dating apps are full of scammers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/18tz19q/scammed_in_shanghai_need_help_recovering_money/) if you're worried about scammers, [read this](https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1ilyfrg/visiting_shanghai_read_this_before_you_get_scammed/), although dont worry too much about it. maybe keep some distance and you'll be fine.

### Safety

despite the amount of people, china's one of the safest countries out there. just dont do stupid stuff, avoid chinese politics, and you'll be fine. *ive walked in many random places at 3 am, not a single concern.*

### Smoking

if you're sentitive to smoking like me, sorry to tell you, you'll have a bad time with this: smokers, smokers everywhere.

most public bathrooms, KTVs, and taxis smell like cigarrete. if you take trains between cities, do NOT take the old style train (the suspiciously cheap ones), people smoke on those.

*before covid, people smoked more on private places like restaurants. sometimes, it still happens, but it's slowly improving.*


# 7. what’s next?

once you’ve survived the first few weeks, you’ll start getting the hang of things. make local friends, improve your chinese, and enjoy the ride. make sure to keep an eye on important dates (flights, legal stuff) and your legal papers like visas and residence permits.

China’s an experience - overwhelming at first, but you’ll learn to love it. hopefully. most of us do.

*if youre coming soon and freaking out a bit or have a specific question, you may drop a message on my [telegram](https://t.me/yo_o_n). say you come from this website.*
